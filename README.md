## Something I learned ##
 You, as a programmer, are someone solving problems to help others.<br> And to do that, you must understand the situation clearly by asking the right question and then reducing complexity to simplicity.<br>
The programmer is also a designer, and your design should be easy and helpful for others, so keep it as simple as you can.<br>
In the end, the most potent thing you must do is Keep learning.
