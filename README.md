### Something I learned ###
 You, as a programmer, are someone solving problems to help others. And to do that, you must understand the situation clearly by asking the right question and then reducing complexity to simplicity.
The programmer is also a designer, and your design should be easy and helpful for others, so keep it as simple as you can.
In the end, the most potent thing you must do is Keep learning.
