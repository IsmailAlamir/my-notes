Through my reading, I believe a programmer is someone solving problems to help others and to do that; you must understand the situation clearly by asking the right question and then reducing complexity to simplicity.
The programmer is also a designer, and your design should be easy and helpful for others, so keep it simple.
In the end, the most potent thing you must do is Keep learning.
